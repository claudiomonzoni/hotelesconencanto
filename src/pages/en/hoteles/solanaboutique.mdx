## Zihuatanejo bay for you

**Solana boutique bed & breakfast** is a small hotel with only seven rooms nestled on a hillside with a beautiful view of Zihuatanejo Bay. Our view is stunning and the location is quiet, ideal for a getaway. A vacation to Solana is a respite from the stress of the pace of modern life. Our tropical garden ensures your privacy and provides a habitat for birds and butterflies. Wake up in the morning to parrot songs, swim in our crystal-clear pool and have a cocktail on our terrace surrounded by the beauty of the tropical Pacific coast.

**Our breakfasts are complementary**. We offer a main dish every morning in addition to a variety of fresh fruit, homemade bread, granola, tea, juice and coffee from the mountains of the state of Guerrero. What's more, our chef is available from 12:00 to 8:00 to prepare drinks or a light meal if your day includes nothing more than relaxing by the pool. A full dinner can be arranged 24 hours in advance. In our little hotel you can also have access to a self-service bar in the palapa area for the purchase of soft drinks, juices, beer and wine.

We love living in Zihuatanejo and enjoy sharing restaurant and activity recommendations with our guests. Nearby activities include a tour to the pre-Hispanic ruins of Chole, a cruise tour, and water sports at Playa La Ropa. Once they arrive many guests also find that the best activity of all is nothing more than kicking back and relaxing under the tropical sun.
